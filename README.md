# login_page
User registration system built with Django's built-in authentication backend, as 
well as a custom module for generating a secure password and custom page templates.
Users can register and log in with a username and password, and they can reset 
their password by requesting an email with a link to the password reset page.
For development purposes, the 'sent' emails are stored in a folder within the 
project directory.
